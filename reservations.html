<section id="information-book">We are located 57 Toorak Road West, South Yarra. The Bar Menu is available daily from noon onwards for walk-in only.
<br>
Our early sittings have a maximum of two hours - therefore if you are wanting a longer sitting time we suggest you book a later time slot.
<br>
Our children's menu is available for children under 12. Due to our limited space we are unable to accommodate prams.
<br>
We do not allow any outside food or beverage to be consumed on our premises. You can order one of our Celebration Cakes with at least 48 hours notice before your reservation.
<br>
A 10% surcharge applies on weekends, a 15% surcharge applies on all public holidays. Card transactions incur a 1.5% surcharge.

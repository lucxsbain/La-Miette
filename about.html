	<main id="about-3">Frederick Williamson is a talented chef who has gained lots of experience by travelling to different parts of the world and working in high-end restaurants alongside some of the most famous chefs in the world. He has spent many years working in Europe, learning about different cuisines and techniques. Now, he has decided to make Melbourne his home and open his own restaurant. His skills in the kitchen are so impressive that he has even earned a Michelin Star, which is a very prestigious award given to the best chefs in the world. People are very excited to taste the delicious food he will create at his new restaurant.</main>
	<main id="about-4">Born in Bath, in the south of England, to two loving parents. Frederick’s father was a chief in the Cappadocia Mediterranean Restaurant, this exposed Frederick to an exotic cuisine he otherwise would not have experienced. This inspired Frederick to follow in his father's footsteps and become a chief, unfortunately at the age of 27 his father passed away from pneumonia. This prompted him to travel the world expanding his talents.</main>
